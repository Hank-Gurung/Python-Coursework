# Python-Coursework
This is python coursework given by college for laptop shop system.
A laptop shop buys laptops/computers from manufacturers and sells it to various
customers which may be individuals or companies. Orders for computers can be
placed for the manufacturers. Likewise, customers can place orders for computers to
our laptop shop (distributor).
The laptop rental shop manages information about the available computers in a
text file. A program that can read the text file to display all the laptops available and
make changes to the text file according to the nature of the transaction (ordering from
manufacturer/selling to customer) needs to be developed. With each order or sale
made, a note/receipt should be generated with the details of the transaction. The stock
of a particular laptop should also be updated in the main text file itself. For example,
if the shop currently has 19 pieces of Razer Blade, and a customer buys 2 of it, the
stock should be updated to 17. In case the rental shop purchases 5 Razer Blade
laptops, the stock should then be updated from 17 to 22 i.e. the stock should be
increased by 5.
